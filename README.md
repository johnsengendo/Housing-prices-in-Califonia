# Housing-prices-in-Califonia
In this repository work on building a machine learning model that uses Califonia census data which has attributes like; Population, median income, median housing price, longitude, latitude for each small district in the region.
The model will use this data to learn and be able to predict the median housing price of any district give the other attributes.

Before going deeper into building models, I first downloaded the [Dataset]( https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ageron/handson-ml2/master/datasets/housing/housing.tgz), explore and visualize it to gain ingights.
Below we see the entries.
This helps in cleaning up attributes that maynot be relevant for the machine learning models.
