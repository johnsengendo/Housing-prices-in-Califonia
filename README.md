# Housing-prices-in-Califonia
In this repository I build a machine learning model that uses the califonia census data which has attributes like; Population, Median income, median housing price, longitude, latitude. For each small district.
The model will use this data to learn and be able to predict the median housing price of any district give the other attributes.
